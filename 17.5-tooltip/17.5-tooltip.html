        <p>
            Looney Tunes is an American animated comedy short film series produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.">Warner Bros</a>. from 1930 to 1969, along with an accompanying series, Merrie Melodies, during the golden age of American animation.[2][3] The two series introduced Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Wile E. Coyote, the Road Runner, Tweety, Sylvester, Granny, Yosemite Sam, the Tasmanian Devil, Marvin the Martian, Pep√© Le Pew, Foghorn Leghorn, Speedy Gonzales and many other cartoon characters. </p>

            ooney Tunes (and Merrie Melodies) were initially produced by Leon Schlesinger and animators Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising from 1930 to 1933.[4] Schlesinger assumed full production from 1933 until selling his studio to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.">Warner Bros</a>. in 1944.[4] The Looney Tunes name was inspired by Walt Disney's musical cartoon series, Silly Symphonies.[4] The shorts initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as Bosko and, after losing him, Buddy.[4] However, the animation studio gained a higher profile after it brought in directors Tex Avery and Chuck Jones and voice actor Mel Blanc in the mid-1930s.[4] Porky Pig and Daffy Duck became the main stars of Looney Tunes at this time, while Merrie Melodies featured one-shot cartoons and minor recurring characters.[4]</p>
